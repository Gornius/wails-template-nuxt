Minimal Nuxt template for Wails. Leverage the developer experience of Nuxt with amazing speed of
Wails to create cross-platform GUI apps.

## Auto-import
ðŸ‘‰ Supports runtime auto-import out of the box
ðŸ«¸ Doesn't support bindings auto-import due to the possible function name collisions

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. In another terminal, go into the `frontend`
directory and run `npm run dev`. The frontend dev server will run on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your
browser and connect to your application.
